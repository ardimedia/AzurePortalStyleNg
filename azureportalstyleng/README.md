# AzurePortalStyleNg

...or better **Angular Portal - Azure style** ;-)

We are in the process to clean up this project and make it production ready.

There are may possibilities how this will all end, but our thoughts go into this direction:

- rename to **angular-portal-azure**
- remove the NuGet package
- implement a npm package
- move from angular 1 to angular 2
- lots of clean up
- bring more from the Azure style into this package

For now --- happy coding ;-)
