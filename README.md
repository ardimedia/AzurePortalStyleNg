# azureportalstyleng

Very early preview.

azure-portal-style-ng (=angular) is an GUI framework for building Azure style interfaces based on Angular 1.

## Roadmap

We are in the process of cleaning this release. Here we will focus on Angular 1.   
It will be a `interim` step, moving forward with **angular-portal-azure** project.

### Todo

- Rename azureportalstyleng to azureportaleng (sources are renamed, rename Github repository)
